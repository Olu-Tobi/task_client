4. **React Frontend**: The frontend is built using React.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.

5. **Node.js Backend**: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, offering a robust and scalable server architecture.

6. **RESTful API**: The application provides a RESTful API for various operations, including user management, post creation, and image uploads.

7. **User Profile**: Users can create and customize their profiles, including avatars and profile information.

8. **Real-time Features**: Incorporate real-time features like live chat or notifications.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js and npm: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

- PostgreSQL: [Download and install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- FirestoreDB: You should have a FirestoreDB project set up on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

4. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory to configure environment variables. Example:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/yourdb

   ```

2. Configure Firebase SDK for FirestoreDB in the frontend. Update `client/src/firebase.js` with your Firebase credentials:

   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "your-api-key",
     authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
     appId: "your-app-id",
   };
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the server (from the `server` directory):

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server (from the `client` directory):

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
